# CipherBreaker
Short project, used to help solve substitution ciphers

### Make sure to download the provided dictionary or use your own dictionary when running the code, separate each word by a newline ###

# First Prompt #
Input 1 to Input text

Input 2 to Read from file

# Second Prompt #
Input 1 to find the pattern of the word (EX: banana = abcbcb)

Input 2 to find a list of all matching words to the pattern (EX: banana: batata, bororo, carara, derere, ...)

# Notes #
Make sure you cd into the directory where your dictionary is stored 

Change name of dictionary to "word_alpha.txt" or change it in the code on Line 46

I found this helps for longer texts of substitution ciphers, if you find the longest word in a ciphertext, you can run the code with the ciphertext
and find possible words for the ciphertext, adding it into your key to help decipher the rest of the text
